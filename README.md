Use dimple.js/d3.js for visualization 

## Design

This is my project 6 for Data Analytics. I am interested in the powerball game and want to see the number distribution in the drawing history. I wrote an Python program to scrape history data from powerball webiste and used dimple.js and d3.js to visualize the drawing distribution since the new rule on October 2015. 

First I chose a scatter plot to show the red ball number and average white ball number over time. This allows me to visualize any possible pattern over time. Next, I shared my work and got feedback to show the distribution of numbers. Therefore, I created histogram to show the count for each number in the history. This allows me to evaluate if the number distribution is randome or follows a certain pattern. 

## Feedback
*1. You web page has nice layout. However, I looked at your data visualization for quite some time as it is hard for a person who know nothing about power ball to understand the meaning of this plot. I read through the lines and learn that you want to understand whether powerball number of each draw is randomly distributed. Would you consider using a histogram or boxplot as it will more clearly show the data distribution patter.*

*PS: I think it is a hard topic for data visualization, as it is not easy to discover any patter just as you described.....*

*2. I agree with @heshuangsara. The points look random enough, but it would be helpful to see a histogram or box plot to better understand the distribution.*

*Also, perhaps you can provide a link to a video of a drawing (for those who are not familiar with powerball).*
